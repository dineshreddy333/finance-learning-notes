# Finance & Analytics Learning Notes

This repository contains my learning notes and understanding of:

- Fixed Deposits and interest rate mechanisms  
- Mutual fund types and risk–return concepts  
- Basics of stock market investing  
- Analytical comparison of financial products  

I am exploring how data and analytics can be applied in fintech platforms
to improve transparency and decision-making.
